    "Players engage with video games in many different ways. Some log in only for short sessions, while others spend much more time exploring and return more frequently. Beyond in-game activities, players also differ in how closely they stay connected to the game’s community. One way to stay engaged is by subscribing to the game’s newsletter for updates and upcoming events. Because subscription rates often reflect higher interest and community involvement, it’s useful to identify which types of players are more likely to subscribe. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two data sets: players.csv and sessions.csv center on real data collected from the UBC Computer Science research group studying player behaviour on a Minecraft server. The goal for the research is to better target recruitment and ensure they have adequate server resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "To support the research group’s recruitment efforts, our project aims to answer the question: Can the played hours, and age of a player predict whether or not they subscribed to the newsletter in the players dataset? This helps determine which factors are most associated with engagement so the group can better tailor their efforts accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only be working with players.csv, which includes data about all unique players. It contains information such as name, age, played hours, subscription status, and more. A detailed description of the dataset is provided below:\n",

    "\n",
    "We start by loading the R libraries we need for this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import the players.csv dataset and clean it up. Variables like gender, experience level, and subscription status are converted to factors. The subscription variable originally uses TRUE/FALSE, so we recorded it to “Yes” and “No” for clarity. Player names are removed as it’s not necessary for our analysis. We’re looking at a general trend rather than specific data for each player. Any rows with missing values are also dropped to make sure the modeling runs smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploratory Data Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a quick sense for the data, we created a few plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A histogram showing the relationship between subscription status and hours played on the server.\n",
    "- A histogram showing the age distribution of subscribers versus non-subscribers.\n",
    "- A scatterplot of age versus hours played to see if certain age and playtime combinations are linked to subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "These visualizations give a quick overview of how the predictors relate to subscription and help us see what patterns might exist before modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modeling Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification to predict a player’s subscription status using Age and played_hours as predictors and subscribe as the response variable. We do not include experience level or gender because KNN requires numerical predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is appropriate here because the response variable is categorical, and the predictors are numerical. KNN can capture non-linear relationships and is flexible. We assume the data is tidy and that all predictors contribute equally, which is why we standardize the data using centering and scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is split into a training set (75%) and a test set (25%) while keeping the same proportion of subscribers in each set. Standardization is applied only to the training set using step_center and step_scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tune the number of neighbors k from 1 to 30 and use 5-fold cross-validation on the training data to identify the most accurate value of k. \n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting the best k, the code trains a final KNN model on the full training set and then evaluates it on the test data. This allows us to see how well age and playtime can actually predict which players are more engaged and likely to subscribe.\n"
